# Quick Socket Chat!

The socket chat is a quick and "easy" exploration of the web socket [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). I used the website to explore and learn a bit more about web sockets, how to make them, and how they work!

This can be cloned from GitHub and with an NPM install  can be run on local host and tested between two different tabs.

The next steps for this little practice run will be setting up a user authentification, and nicknames for each of the users to see who said what and hopefully track users.
